# Devamped
A texture pack that aimed to be terraria-ish and simplified vanilla styles for bedrock edition.

This is a restarted project, originally started on 2023 and reset in 2026.

Project will be constantly getting update there and here as a hobby project. Release is random so, don't expect a daily updates!

# Java Edition?
A Original version is, uh. much of a hellscape due to that. so, No port until a major version is done.
Contribution are welcome.

# Do note that
- The texture pack is NOT finished.
- Update might be slow sometimes due to personal life stuff.
